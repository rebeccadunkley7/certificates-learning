# Learning & Development Showcase
Links to files acknowledging completion of technical course & module completion, as a result of self-directed learning outside of work hours.

Over the past 24 months, I have dedicated alot of time to upskilling my technical abilities to transition from no-code alternatives (such as Alteryx) to gaining confidence in both SQL & Python. You can find a timeline of my L&D priorities below, with evidence of learning milestones as I have completed learning courses.
